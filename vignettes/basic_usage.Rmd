# Introduction

The purpose of the `mrgvalidate` package is specifically to generate three documents that are necessary for the software validation process at Mertrum Research Group. Those documents are:

* requirements-specification.docx
* validation-testing.docx
* traceability-matrix.docx

This vignette demonstrates how to generate these with a few simple library calls.

```{r setup}
library(mrgvalidate)
```

# Initial setup

**WIP: THIS NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN (and will probably be quite short) FOR THE NEW INTERFACE POST-`mrgvalidate`**
